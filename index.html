					<p>Hey, I'm Orcun! Based in Germany. 28 years old. I build handy iOS apps around my everyday life.</p>
					<p><strong>I'm a full stack app creator</strong>. I love going through the whole process: From the initial idea, to UX and UI drafts, to development.</p>

				<h2>Apps I Have Created</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="row pb-4">
				<p>There are so many awesome apps out there! For example <a href="https://www.getbring.com/#!/app">Bring!</a>, a shopping list app that I use since 2012. Or the official <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter App</a>, which is seamlessly integrated into iOS and has a great UX.</p>
				<p>But there are also niche areas out there. In my everyday life I find a lot of these niches which need better solutions. And creating great apps for niche areas is exactly what I do! I do this for fun, for a passive income and to try out new technologies.</p>

						WORK
						<small class="text-muted">Late 2017</small>
					</h4>
					<p class="h6 mb-4">Track Your Working Time</p>
					<p>WORK is a minimalist app for working time tracking with a focus on fast data input. Suitable for employees, freelancers and anyone else who wants to keep an eye on their working hours.</p>
					<p>The time tracking takes place with the help of the smart user guidance without occupying much time. As a result, the app can be integrated into the daily work without disturbing it. For example changing the current task happens with 3 or less taps.</p>
					<div class="border-left border-secondary">
						<p class="text-muted ml-3">I created WORK because I have searched myself for a simple tool to track my working time. All apps I tried were to complicated. Too many options and complicated user flows. I wanted an app that is as easy to use as possible.</p>

						Pilly! 2
						<small class="text-muted">Late 2015</small>
					</h4>
					<p class="h6 mb-4">Smart Pill Reminder</p>
					<p>Pilly! is the most elegant pill reminder on the App Store. The intuitive user interface and powerful features will let you never forget the pill again.</p>
					<p>Pilly! helps you to manage the pill in your menstrual cycle. You are getting reliably reminded to take your pill while always having an overview of your whole cycle. Thanks to the intelligent navigation you can easily switch through the days of cycle and enter notes, your personal wellbeing and the menstrual flow.</p>
					<div class="border-left border-secondary">
						<p class="text-muted ml-3">Since Pilly! was the first app I have ever developed, the code architecture was not so good. That's why I decided to completely redevelop the app. The result: Pilly! 2. New UX, new features and maintainable code. Btw, this was my first Swift project!</p>

					<p class="h6 mb-4">Manage Repeating ToDo's</p>
					<p>There are things you have to do frequently. So you want to do sports at least every 3 days and you want to go to the hairdresser every 4 weeks, for example. You also want to give yourself a treat and so you want to dine out with your sweetie every 2 weeks and have a massage every 1 or 2 month. Equally you have to do the laundry at least once a weak, vacuum every 4 days and take out the trash routinely.</p>
					<p>That's quite a lot to remember, right? Because of that we have developed redo to remind you for those ordinary things. And the best thing about it is that you can do that as easy as pie!</p>
					<div class="border-left border-secondary">
